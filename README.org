#+Title: Space astrometry of the very massive ∼150 M⊙ candidate runaway star VFTS682

Code associated to the [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482L.102R/abstract][Renzo et al. 2019a]]. In this paper we used /Gaia/
DR2 data to test the kinematics of a >150M_{\odot} star, VFTS682, and
found it was plausibly ejected from the core of the R136 cluster,
despite being that massive. This possibly makes it the third
>100M_{\odot} star ejected from this cluster, together with VFTS72 and
VFTS16 [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...619A..78L/abstract][Lennon et al. 2018]], and the most massive runaway star known to
date.
