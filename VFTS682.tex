\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

How do stars form is one longstanding question in astrophysics \cite{lada:03}
\todo{ref?}. Answering it for massive stars is particularly difficult,
since these are intrinsically rare
\citep[e.g.,][]{salpeter:55,kroupa:01, schneider:18}, evolve fast, and
remain enshrouded in their parent cloud during the whole formation
process \todo{ref}. Moreover, observations of young massive stars reveal a
complicated multipliticy structure which requires
explanation \citep[][]{kobulnicky:07,mason:09,sana:11,sana:12,kiminki:12,chini:12,kobulnicky:14,almeida:17,demarco:17}. Understanding massive star formation, possibly as a
function of metallicity, is a key question given the present and upcoming
transient survey \citep[e.g., LSST, BlackGem, LIGO/Virgo O3][]{} which
will reveal transients associated to massive stars
evolution and death.

\todo{short summary of formation scenarios goes here}.


The second data release (DR2) from the Gaia satellite
\cite[][]{brown:18,} allows us to test
these hypothesis using one particular star, VFTS682. This star is a
very massive ($\sim$$150\,M_\odot$) WNh5 star in the 30 Doradus region
of the Large Magellanic Cloud, and it is presently observed at a
projected distance of $\sim$$29$\,pc from the nearest cluster of
massive stars R136 \citep[][]{bestenlehner:11}. Based on the extremely high mass of this star and
its present day apparent isolation, \cite{bestenlehner:11} proposed it
might be a candidate for isolated star formation, or a runaway ejected
from R136 in the past.

Massive stars can in principle be ejected from R136 as a consequence of dynamical
interactions \citep[][]{poveda:67,leonard:91, evans:10, fujii:11,
  allison:12, oh:16}, or by the disruption of a binary by the first
core-collapse supernova
\citep[][]{zwicky:57,blaauw:61,dedonder:97,eldridge:11,renzo:18}. However,
R136 has an estimated age of $\lessim2$\,Myr \todo{ref}, which is
shorter than the shortest stellar lifetime of about $\sim$3\,Myr
\citep[e.g.,][]{zapartas:17}, so one would not expect the binary
disruption scenario to be relevant for this cluster.


In this study, we combine the radial velocity measurements from the
VFTS survey \citep[][]{evans:11} with the proper motion from Gaia DR2
to reconstruct the three-dimensional velocity of VFTS682, and test the
null hypothesis that this star was ejected from R136. \todo{check the
  following} Our results indicate that R136 is the likely origin of
this star, and therefore isolated star formation is \emph{not}
required to explain it. However, we find a mild discrepancy between the
apparent age of VFTS682, its kinematic age, and the age estimates for
R136. 

In \Secref{sec:sample}, we describe how we select stars in R136 and in
the surroundings of VFTS682 itself to remove the mean motion of the
region. \Secref{sec:results} presents our main findings. We conclude by
discussing the implications for theories of
star formation, N-body interactions, and binary evolution in
\Secref{sec:discussion}.

\section{Gaia DR2 data selection}
\label{sec:sample}
VFTS682 is labeled in the Gaia DR2
catalog\footnote{\url{https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/}} with the
source id 4657685637907503744. For this star, we retrieve from the
Gaia catalog its position in right ascension (RA) and declination (DE)
in the IGCS frame\cite[][]{brown:18}\todo{some 2016 Gaia paper?}, its
proper motion components ($\mu_\mathrm{RA}$, and $\mu_\mathrm{DE}$,
respectively). For the radial velocity of VFTS682 and of the 30 Doradus
region as a whole, we instead use the VFTS data
as quoted in \cite{bestenlehner:11}. Our main conclusions do not
depend on the detailed value of the radial velocity.\todo{improve
  phrasing} \Tabref{tab:vfts682} lists the values adopted throughout
this work for each of these quantities.

\begin{table}[tbp]
  \centering
    \caption{Astrometric parameters for VFTS682. The peculiar radial
    velocity $\delta v_\mathrm{rad}$ is obtained as the difference
    between the average radial velocity of the 30 Doradus region
    ($270\pm10\kms$) minus the radial velocity measured from the HeII $\lambda4686$
    line for VFTS682 ($315\pm15\kms$).}

  \begin{tabular}[htbp]{l|c|c}
    Parameter & Value & Source\\ \hline\hline
    RA \hfill[degree] &  84.73 $\pm$  0.036 & \multirow{4}{*}{Gaia DR2}\\
    DE \hfill [degree] & -69.07 $\pm$  0.05  & \\
    $\mu_\mathrm{RA}$  \hfill[$\mathrm{mas\ yr^{-1}}$] & 1.84 $\pm$ 0.07 & \\
    $\mu_\mathrm{DE}$  \hfill[$\mathrm{mas\ yr^{-1}}$] & 0.78 $\pm$ 0.08& \\
    $\delta v_\mathrm{rad}$  \hfill[$\kms$] & -45 $\pm$ 25 & \cite{bestenlehner:11}\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:vfts682}
\end{table}

To compare the astrometry of VFTS682 and derive its peculiar motion,
we then select data from the Gaia DR2 catalog for two regions: the
``surroundings'' of VFTS 682, and the ``R136 cluster''. The
surrounding region is defined by all the stars within 10 arcminutes from
VFTS682. This includes the subset of stars which we consider to be
part of R136. We include all the stars for which a value of the proper
motion components and the corresponding errors are available.
The ``R136 cluster'' is effectively defined by taking all the stars
within 25 arcseconds from R136a, one of the most massive members of
the cluster itself \citep[][]{crowther:10}.

Throughout this study, we assume the same distance of $50$\,kpc to the star, and to
the 30 Doradus region as a whole, since the parallax for VFTS682
listed in the Gaia DR2 catalog is negative.
